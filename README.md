# Vagrant configuration for Pintos dev box

This repository contains a simple [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) configuration 
and bootstrap script to create a Pintos dev box for the [JHU CS318](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~huang/cs318/fall20) course. 

If you already have a Vagrant Ubuntu 18 box, you'll only need to add a provision 
entry to your existing `Vagrantfile` to use the `bootstrap.sh` file.
